**ByteWard** is an autonomous, validator-enforced smart contract upgrade control plane native to [GenLayer](https://genlayer.com). It permanently eliminates the single point of failure in decentralized applications: **centralized admin keys, vulnerable multisigs, and rogue upgrade proposals**.

- [ ] **Phase 2 (Cryptoeconomic Guardrails):** Native `GEN` escrow deposits for proposals, stake-to-challenge bonding to eliminate griefing, malicious upgrade slashing, and automated whitehat bug bounty disbursements.
- [ ] **Phase 3 (Cross-Chain L2 Control Plane):** Cross-chain messaging bridges enabling ByteWard on GenLayer to govern proxy bytecode updates on Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Ethereum mainnet.
- [ ] **Phase 4 (Zero-Knowledge AST Proofs):** Pairing GenLayer natural language semantic audits with formal ZK bytecode verification for mathematically proven upgrades.

## The Problem: The Web3 Upgradability Trilemma

In traditional smart contract architectures, developers face an irreconcilable trade-off:

```
                  THE UPGRADABILITY TRILEMMA
                  
                   [1. Static Immutability]
                   • Zero feature evolution
                   • Unpatchable zero-day bugs
                            /\
                           /  \
                          /    \
                         /      \
                        /        \
 [2. Centralized Admin Keys] ---- [3. Multisig Quorums]
 • Key leaks & SIM swaps           • Low quorum collusion
 • Rogue developer drains          • Social engineering attacks
```

- Over **$2.8 Billion** has been lost in DeFi to compromised developer private keys, phished multisig signers, and stealth malicious proxy upgrades.
- When human keys hold upgrade authority, any key compromise results in an **instant, irreversible protocol drain**.

## The Solution: The ByteWard Sentinel Engine

ByteWard eliminates human admin keys from the upgrade pipeline by transferring exclusive upgrade authority to an **on-chain, multi-validator AI consensus firewall**.

1. **Exclusive Authority Delegation:** Target smart contracts delegate their root upgrader slot strictly to the ByteWard controller contract (`is_sole_guard_authorized() == True`).
2. **Commit-Pinned Ingestion:** Upgrades must be submitted via immutable 40-character commit SHA GitHub raw URLs. Mutable branch references (such as `main` or `dev`) are deterministically rejected.
3. **5-Tier Sentinel Firewalls:** GenLayer AI validators non-deterministically fetch baseline and candidate bytecode diffs, executing five rigorous safety audits under consensus.
4. **Structured Equivalence Normalization:** Qualitative natural language review prose is preserved on-chain for human inspection, while consensus matching operates on a normalized tuple of strict boolean safety invariants.
5. **On-Chain Dispute Snapshots:** Proposals enter a timelocked challenge window where community whitehats can submit HTTPS evidence links. ByteWard snapshots the raw evidence bytes permanently into contract storage to prevent dynamic URL tampering.
6. **Automated Cross-Contract Bytecode Slot Mutation:** Bytecode replacement is dispatched only when consensus verifies safety invariants and confirms truthful post-upgrade version installation.

## The 5-Tier Sentinel Firewalls

| # | Firewall Name | Purpose & Verification Invariant |
| :-: | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **State Storage Slot Layout Integrity** | Extracts dataclass variables and state slots. Verifies that candidate releases do not prepend, delete, or reorder variables, eliminating storage collision vulnerabilities. |
| **2** | **Sole Guard Upgrade Authority Check** | Inspects root upgrader permissions and constructor logic to ensure ByteWard remains the exclusive upgrade authority with zero backdoor keys. |
| **3** | **Treasury & Drain Movement Protection** | Scans for arbitrary token/ether transfers, uncontrolled `emit_transfer` calls, or emergency withdrawal functions that could allow attackers to drain funds. |
| **4** | **Bounded External Call Invocations** | Ensures all external cross-contract invocations are bounded to known, verified addresses and safe interfaces, preventing reentrancy and arbitrary delegatecalls. |
| **5** | **Governing Charter Semantic Compliance** | Performs natural language semantic LLM audits under AI consensus verifying candidate changes adhere strictly to the target's immutable governing charter. |
